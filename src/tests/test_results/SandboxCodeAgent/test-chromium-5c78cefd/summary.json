On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Your primary goal is to accomplish the user's task by breaking it down into a series of logical steps.\n\nFor each step, you must choose the best method to achieve your goal:\n\n1.  **GUI Automation**: Use the `pyautogui` library to control the mouse and keyboard for tasks that require interacting with graphical elements (e.g., clicking buttons, opening applications, typing in non-accessible fields).\n2.  **Direct Code Execution**: Use Python directly for tasks that are more efficiently handled through code (e.g., performing calculations, manipulating data, reading/writing files, or calling available tools).\n\n**Your Workflow for Each Step:**\n\n* **Think First**: Begin by explaining your plan. Justify why you are choosing either **GUI automation** or **direct code execution** for the current step.\n* **Execute with Code**: Provide the complete Python code to perform the planned action. Remember to include `time.sleep()` after GUI actions that need time to load or process.\n\n**Verification and Final Answer:**\n\nAfter each action, you will receive an **observation** to confirm the result.\n* For **GUI actions**, this will be a screenshot. You must analyze the image to confirm the action was successful.\n* For **direct code**, this will be the execution logs or output. You must check this text to verify the outcome.\n\nTo provide the **final answer**, you must base your conclusion on the final observation.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\n{\"thought\": \"I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \\\"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\\\" Let's answer in one word.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\", \"code\": \"for city in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n      print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\", web_search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\"}\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\n{\"thought\": \"Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\", \"code\": \"pope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google search:\\\", pope_age_search)\"}\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Your primary goal is to accomplish the user's task by breaking it down into a series of logical steps.\n\nFor each step, you must choose the best method to achieve your goal:\n\n1.  **GUI Automation**: Use the `pyautogui` library to control the mouse and keyboard for tasks that require interacting with graphical elements (e.g., clicking buttons, opening applications, typing in non-accessible fields).\n2.  **Direct Code Execution**: Use Python directly for tasks that are more efficiently handled through code (e.g., performing calculations, manipulating data, reading/writing files, or calling available tools).\n\n**Your Workflow for Each Step:**\n\n* **Think First**: Begin by explaining your plan. Justify why you are choosing either **GUI automation** or **direct code execution** for the current step.\n* **Execute with Code**: Provide the complete Python code to perform the planned action. Remember to include `time.sleep()` after GUI actions that need time to load or process.\n\n**Verification and Final Answer:**\n\nAfter each action, you will receive an **observation** to confirm the result.\n* For **GUI actions**, this will be a screenshot. You must analyze the image to confirm the action was successful.\n* For **direct code**, this will be the execution logs or output. You must check this text to verify the outcome.\n\nTo provide the **final answer**, you must base your conclusion on the final observation. Confirm that the task is complete by reviewing the last screenshot or the final code output.\n---\n\n**Your Task:**\nTry to open the chromium browser from the sidebar."

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\n{\"thought\": \"I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \\\"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\\\" Let's answer in one word.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\", \"code\": \"for city in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n      print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\", web_search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\"}\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\n{\"thought\": \"Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\", \"code\": \"pope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google search:\\\", pope_age_search)\"}\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Your primary goal is to accomplish the user's task by breaking it down into a series of logical steps.\n\nFor each step, you must choose the best method to achieve your goal:\n\n1.  **GUI Automation**: Use the `pyautogui` library to control the mouse and keyboard for tasks that require interacting with graphical elements (e.g., clicking buttons, opening applications, typing in non-accessible fields).\n2.  **Direct Code Execution**: Use Python directly for tasks that are more efficiently handled through code (e.g., performing calculations, manipulating data, reading/writing files, or calling available tools).\n\n**Your Workflow for Each Step:**\n\n* **Think First**: Begin by explaining your plan. Justify why you are choosing either **GUI automation** or **direct code execution** for the current step.\n* **Execute with Code**: Provide the complete Python code to perform the planned action. Remember to include `time.sleep()` after GUI actions that need time to load or process.\n\n**Verification and Final Answer:**\n\nAfter each action, you will receive an **observation** to confirm the result.\n* For **GUI actions**, this will be a screenshot. You must analyze the image to confirm the action was successful.\n* For **direct code**, this will be the execution logs or output. You must check this text to verify the outcome.\n\nTo provide the **final answer**, you must base your conclusion on the final observation. Confirm that the task is complete by reviewing the last screenshot or the final code output.\n---\n\n**Your Task:**\nTry to open the chromium browser from the sidebar."

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\n{\"thought\": \"I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \\\"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\\\" Let's answer in one word.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\", \"code\": \"for city in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n      print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\", web_search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\"}\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\n{\"thought\": \"Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\", \"code\": \"pope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google search:\\\", pope_age_search)\"}\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Your primary goal is to accomplish the user's task by breaking it down into a series of logical steps.\n\nFor each step, you must choose the best method to achieve your goal:\n\n1.  **GUI Automation**: Use the `pyautogui` library to control the mouse and keyboard for tasks that require interacting with graphical elements (e.g., clicking buttons, opening applications, typing in non-accessible fields).\n2.  **Direct Code Execution**: Use Python directly for tasks that are more efficiently handled through code (e.g., performing calculations, manipulating data, reading/writing files, or calling available tools).\n\n**Your Workflow for Each Step:**\n\n* **Think First**: Begin by explaining your plan. Justify why you are choosing either **GUI automation** or **direct code execution** for the current step.\n* **Execute with Code**: Provide the complete Python code to perform the planned action. Remember to include `time.sleep()` after GUI actions that need time to load or process.\n\n**Verification and Final Answer:**\n\nAfter each action, you will receive an **observation** to confirm the result.\n* For **GUI actions**, this will be a screenshot. You must analyze the image to confirm the action was successful.\n* For **direct code**, this will be the execution logs or output. You must check this text to verify the outcome.\n\nTo provide the **final answer**, you must base your conclusion on the final observation. Confirm that the task is complete by reviewing the last screenshot or the final code output.\n---\n\n**Your Task:**\nTry to open the chromium browser from the sidebar."
