Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n",

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results. Let's try again with a broader query.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nFound 6 pages:\n[Stanislaus Ulam 1979 interview](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/)\n\n[Ulam discusses Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/)\n\n(truncated)\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will read the first 2 pages to know more.\", \"code\": \"for url in [\\\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/oral-histories/stanislaus-ulams-interview-1979/\\\", \\\"https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/manhattan-project/ulam-manhattan-project/\\\"]:\\n      whole_page = visit_webpage(url)\\n      print(whole_page)\\n      print(\\\"\\n\\\" + \\\"=\\\"*80 + \\\"\\n\\\")  # Print separator between pages\"}\n\nObservation:\nManhattan Project Locations:\nLos Alamos, NM\nStanislaus Ulam was a Polish-American mathematician. He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\n{\"thought\": \"I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \\\"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\\\" Let's answer in one word.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\", \"code\": \"for city in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n      print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\", web_search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\"}\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\n{\"thought\": \"Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\", \"code\": \"pope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google search:\\\", pope_age_search)\"}\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

                "text": "New task:\nYou are an expert autonomous agent in a sandboxed GUI environment. Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

                "text": "New task:\nYou are an expert autonomous agent in a sandboxed GUI environment. Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

He worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos and later helped design the hydrogen bomb. In this interview, he discusses his work at\n(truncated)\n\n{\"thought\": \"I now have the final answer: from the webpages visited, Stanislaus Ulam says of Einstein: \\\"He learned too much mathematics and sort of diminished, it seems to me personally, it seems to me his purely physics creativity.\\\" Let's answer in one word.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"diminished\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"Which city has the highest population: Guangzhou or Shanghai?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to get the populations for both cities and compare them: I will use the tool `web_search` to get the population of both cities.\", \"code\": \"for city in [\\\"Guangzhou\\\", \\\"Shanghai\\\"]:\\n      print(f\\\"Population {city}:\\\", web_search(f\\\"{city} population\\\")\"}\nObservation:\nPopulation Guangzhou: ['Guangzhou has a population of 15 million inhabitants as of 2021.']\nPopulation Shanghai: '26 million (2019)'\n\n{\"thought\": \"Now I know that Shanghai has the highest population.\", \"code\": \"final_answer(\\\"Shanghai\\\")\"}\n\n---\nTask: \"What is the current age of the pope, raised to the power 0.36?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use the tool `wikipedia_search` to get the age of the pope, and confirm that with a web search.\", \"code\": \"pope_age_wiki = wikipedia_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per wikipedia:\\\", pope_age_wiki)\\npope_age_search = web_search(query=\\\"current pope age\\\")\\nprint(\\\"Pope age as per google search:\\\", pope_age_search)\"}\nObservation:\nPope age: \"The pope Francis is currently 88 years old.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I know that the pope is 88 years old. Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

                "text": "New task:\nYou are an expert autonomous agent in a sandboxed GUI environment. Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

                "text": "New task:\nYou are an expert autonomous agent in a sandboxed GUI environment. Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n"

You will be given a task to solve as best you can.\nTo do so, you have been given access to a list of tools: these tools are basically Python functions which you can call with code.\nTo solve the task, you must plan forward to proceed in a series of steps, in a cycle of 'Thought:', 'Code:', and 'Observation:' sequences.\n\nAt each step, in the 'Thought:' attribute, you should first explain your reasoning towards solving the task and the tools that you want to use.\nThen in the 'Code' attribute, you should write the code in simple Python.\nDuring each intermediate step, you can use 'print()' to save whatever important information you will then need.\nThese print outputs will then appear in the 'Observation:' field, which will be available as input for the next step.\nIn the end you have to return a final answer using the `final_answer` tool. You will be generating a JSON object with the following structure:\n```json\n{\n  \"thought\": \"...\",\n  \"code\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\nHere are a few examples using notional tools:\n---\nTask: \"Generate an image of the oldest person in this document.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will proceed step by step and use the following tools: `document_qa` to find the oldest person in the document, then `image_generator` to generate an image according to the answer.\", \"code\": \"answer = document_qa(document=document, question=\\\"Who is the oldest person mentioned?\\\")\\nprint(answer)\\n\"}\nObservation: \"The oldest person in the document is John Doe, a 55 year old lumberjack living in Newfoundland.\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will now generate an image showcasing the oldest person.\", \"code\": \"image = image_generator(\\\"A portrait of John Doe, a 55-year-old man living in Canada.\\\")\\nfinal_answer(image)\\n\"}\n---\nTask: \"What is the result of the following operation: 5 + 3 + 1294.678?\"\n\n{\"thought\": \"I will use python code to compute the result of the operation and then return the final answer using the `final_answer` tool\", \"code\": \"result = 5 + 3 + 1294.678\\nfinal_answer(result)\\n\"}\n\n---\nTask:\nIn a 1979 interview, Stanislaus Ulam discusses with Martin Sherwin about other great physicists of his time, including Oppenheimer.\nWhat does he say was the consequence of Einstein learning too much math on his creativity, in one word?\n\n{\"thought\": \"I need to find and read the 1979 interview of Stanislaus Ulam with Martin Sherwin.\", \"code\": \"pages = web_search(query=\\\"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\\\")\\nprint(pages)\\n\"}\nObservation:\nNo result found for query \"1979 interview Stanislaus Ulam Martin Sherwin physicists Einstein\".\n\n{\"thought\": \"The query was maybe too restrictive and did not find any results.

Let's compute the result using python code.\", \"code\": \"pope_current_age = 88 ** 0.36\\nfinal_answer(pope_current_age)\"}\n\nAbove example were using notional tools that might not exist for you. On top of performing computations in the Python code snippets that you create, you only have access to these tools, behaving like regular python functions:\n```python\ndef final_answer(answer: any) -> any:\n    \"\"\"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\n\n    Args:\n        answer: The final answer to the problem\n    \"\"\"\n\n```\n\nHere are the rules you should always follow to solve your task:\n1. Use only variables that you have defined!\n2. Always use the right arguments for the tools. DO NOT pass the arguments as a dict as in 'answer = wikipedia_search({'query': \"What is the place where James Bond lives?\"})', but use the arguments directly as in 'answer = wikipedia_search(query=\"What is the place where James Bond lives?\")'.\n3. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to wikipedia_search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n4. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n5. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n6. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n7. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: ['collections', 'datetime', 'itertools', 'math', 'queue', 'random', 're', 'stat', 'statistics', 'time', 'unicodedata']\n8. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n9. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n\nNow Begin!"

                "text": "New task:\nYou are an expert autonomous agent in a sandboxed GUI environment. Your goal is to solve the given task by breaking it down into a sequence of steps.\n\n### Core Workflow\n\nFor each step, follow this process:\n1.  Think: First, explain your plan for the current step. State your goal and justify your chosen method.\n2.  Act: Provide the complete Python code to execute your plan.\n\nYou will receive an observation (a screenshot for GUI actions or terminal output for code execution) after each action. You must analyze it to verify the outcome before proceeding to the next step.\n\n---\n\n### Available Methods\n\nYou must choose the best method for each step, either do a GUI action or use Python code to complete a action step.\n\n- GUI Action: Use pyautogui for interacting with graphical elements.\n    - Best for: Clicking buttons, navigating menus, and interacting with applications that have no direct code interface.\n    - Crucial Rule for GUI: Perform only one or a very small set of closely related GUI actions per step. After each set of GUI actions, you must wait for the next observation (screenshot). Analyze the new screenshot to confirm your action was successful and the UI is in the expected state before planning the next GUI interaction. Do not chain many independent GUI actions without intermediate visual verification.\n    - Forbidden Action: You cannot use pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen or any other image-finding functions in pyautogui. You must determine coordinates by analyzing the provided screenshot and use absolute coordinates (e.g., pyautogui.click(x=100, y=200)).\n    - Requirement: Always add a time.sleep() after actions that require loading time to ensure the UI is ready.\n\n- Direct Code Execution: Directly run Python code for logic, file manipulation, and data processing and other actions.\n    - Best for: Calculations, reading/writing files, making API calls, or any task not requiring direct GUI interaction.\n    - Requirement: Always check the output or logs in the subsequent observation to confirm success and handle any errors. When you think you are done call the final_answer tool.\n    - Tip: Your Jupyter kernel is actived from ~/Desktop so keep in mind that you start from there.\n    - You will be provided with all currently installed Python packages, this so you know what packages you can use. It is possible to install new packages, BUT DO THIS ONLY WHEN REALLY NEEDED; To do so you can use the `!uv pip install <package>` or `!pip install <package>` code\n\n---\n\n### Task Completion and Submission\n\nOnce the task is fully accomplished and verified, you must conclude the mission by calling the `final_answer` tool. This is the final and most critical step.\n\nFunction Signature:\n`final_answer(summary: str)`\n- The `summary` must be a short string literal summarizing your accomplishment. Do not pass variables.\n\nExecution Mandate:\nThe `final_answer()` call must be executed in a standalone code block. No other code, comments, or commands can be in the same execution step.\n\n---\n\nCorrect Usage Example:\n\nYou will submit a code block containing ONLY the final answer call.\n```python\nfinal_answer(\"I successfully downloaded the report and extracted the key figures into 'results.csv'.\")\n```\n\n---\n\nIncorrect Usage Examples:\n\n- Do not include other commands or print statements:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    print(\"Task is complete, submitting final answer.\")\n    final_answer(\"I created the file.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not combine it on a single line:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    import os; final_answer(\"I listed the files.\")\n    ```\n\n- Do not define variables or perform other logic in the same block:\n    ```python\n    # Incorrect\n    summary_text = \"The plot was generated and saved as 'plot.png'.\"\n    final_answer(summary_text)\n    ```\n---\n\nThink before you act, so check if you really need a GUI action step or if you can perform the task by just running Python code and looking at the logs and output\nTASK TO COMPLETE:\n<task>\nI want to see 2019 products with an above average price, show results in result.csv\n</task>\n"
