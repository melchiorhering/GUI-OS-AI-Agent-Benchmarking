Add codes only to the existing cells, and in the end run all the cells and save the jupyter notebook.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task requires you to build a Decision Tree model to classify the onset of diabetes based on different diagnostic measures in a VS Code notebook.\n1.  **Complete #TODO 1:** Locate the first `#TODO` comment. In that cell, add the following two lines to define your feature matrix (X) and target vector (y) from the `pima` DataFrame.\n    ```python\n    X = pima[feature_cols]\n    y = pima.label\n    ```\n2.  **Complete #TODO 2:** Find the second `#TODO` comment. In this section, you will build, train, and test the model. Add the following three lines of code in the specified cell:\n    ```python\n    # First, instantiate a decision tree model.\n    clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=SEED)\n    \n    # Then, fit the decision tree model.\n    clf = clf.fit(X_train,y_train)\n    \n    # Finally, predict the response for the test dataset.\n    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n    ```\n3.  **Run the Notebook:** After you have added all the necessary code, execute the entire notebook to train the model and see the results. Click the **\"Run All\"** icon (it looks like a double play symbol) in the notebook's top toolbar.\n4.  **Save the File:** Once all the cells have completed running, save your finished notebook by pressing the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S`.\nYou can follow the detailed GUI plan above using `pyautogui` or proactively tackle the task using Python code",
