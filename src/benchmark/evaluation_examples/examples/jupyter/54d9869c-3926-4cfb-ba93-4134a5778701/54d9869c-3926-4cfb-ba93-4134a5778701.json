  "instruction": "Help me build a linear SVM model and use it to classify over the famous cancer dataset. Add codes only to the existing cells, and in the end run all the cells and save the jupyter notebook.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task requires you to build a SVM model using scikit-learn and print the accuracy score within a VS Code notebook. Follow the steps:\n1.  **Complete #TODO 1:** In the first cell with a `#TODO` comment, add the following line to import the support vector machine module from scikit-learn:\n    ```python\n    from sklearn import svm\n    ```\n2.  **Complete #TODO 2:** Locate the second `#TODO` and add the following line to create an instance of the support vector classifier with a linear kernel:\n    ```python\n    clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')\n    ```\n3.  **Complete #TODO 3:** Find the third `#TODO` comment and add the following line to train the model on the training data:\n    ```python\n    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    ```\n4.  **Complete #TODO 4:** Below the fourth `#TODO` comment, add the following line to make predictions on the test set:\n    ```python\n    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n    ```\n5.  **Complete #TODO 5:** In the final `#TODO` section, add the following code to print the accuracy score by comparing the test labels to your model's predictions:\n    ```python\n    print(metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n    ```\n6.  **Run the Notebook:** After filling in all the required code, execute the entire notebook. Click the **\"Run All\"** icon (it looks like a double play symbol) in the notebook's top toolbar.\n7.  **Save the File:** Once all the cells have finished running and the accuracy score is printed, save your completed notebook by pressing the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S`.\nYou can follow the detailed GUI plan above using `pyautogui` or proactively tackle the task using Python code",
