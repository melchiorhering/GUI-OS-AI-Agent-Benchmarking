Add codes only to the existing cells, and in the end run all the cells and save the jupyter notebook.\nHere is a step-by-step tutorial from an expert instructing you how to complete it:\nThis task requires you to tune the AdaBoost classifier to achieve a 1.0 accuracy. Follow the steps:\n1. First, locate the correct code cell to edit. Scroll through the notebook to find the section marked with the header **\"Building the AdaBoost Model\"**.\n2. In the code cell immediately following that header, find the line where the `AdaBoostClassifier` is defined. It will look similar to `abc = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=1, learning_rate=0.1)`.\n3. Modify the hyperparameters in that line. Change the value of `n_estimators` from `1` to `40`.\n4. In the same line, change the value of `learning_rate` from `0.1` to `0.8`. The updated line should now be: `abc = AdaBoostClassifier(n_estimators=40, learning_rate=0.8)`.\n5. After editing the code, execute the entire notebook to apply the changes and see the new accuracy. To do this, click the **\"Run All\"** icon (looks like a double play symbol) in the notebook's top toolbar.\n6. Wait for all the cells to finish running. The output of the final cell will now display an \"Accuracy score\" of `1.0`.\n7. Finally, save the updated notebook by pressing the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+S`.\nYou can follow the detailed GUI plan above using `pyautogui` or proactively tackle the task using Python code",
